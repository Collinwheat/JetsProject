# JetsProject

## About This Project
This project describes a list of jets, and different options of what you can do with the data held within them. It reads the initial list from a text file, and then allows the user to add or subtract them. Upon running the JetsApp, the user is free to navigate the menu and manipulate the data of the different jets. The menu is there until the user selects the "Quit" option, where the program will display a "Goodbye" message, and quit.

## Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Zoom, Slack, Google, Github, Terminal

## Lessons Learned
I learned more about the foundations of java, including methods, classes, and objects, and how to apply them in different situations. I learned about ArrayLists and their benefits over regular arrays, as well as the manipulation of them and the syntax needed to do so. I'm still fuzzy on interfaces, but this project definitely aided me in understanding them further. Lastly, I learned further about troubleshooting and debugging.
